# “Cursor: More Than Just Code” — 60‑min Lightning Tour

## Goal of the hands‑on presentation

- Open your mind about what AI tools can do for you and **how they** make you  
- Make you confident **they** can make you 10–100 × faster at the boring tasks

## Step 0 — Warm‑up: Autocomplete & Drop‑in Class
- What most coders think Cursor is good at: short coding snippets

## Step 1 — Tests in 5 Minutes
- *Subjects*: Cursor is reactive and can loop until it reaches a result  
- Scenario: you need test coverage  
- *Tricks / Tools*:  
  - First look at `.cursorrules`  
  - Don’t stop here: make Cursor run the tests  
  - Auto‑execution mode  
- Extra 10 × trick:  
  - Make all your test files executable  
  - Cursor *weirdness* when building tests: keep it in check

## Step 2 — Multi‑File Context & Self‑Docs
- *Subjects*: AI context limits, living documentation  
- Scenario: multi‑file/folder/repo edits  
- *Tricks / Tools*:  
  - Cursor **knows** your codebase: ask it questions  
  - Ask Cursor to map the whole repo → Mermaid diagram  
  - More powerful `.cursorrules`: “keep‑map‑updated” rule

## Step 3 — AI‑Assisted Debugging
- *Subjects*: Cursor is extremely good at debugging!  
- *Tricks / Tools*:  
  - Make Cursor investigate  
  - Make Cursor be responsible **for** convincing you  
  - More `.cursorrules` again: have a bit of fun

## Step 4 — Infra on the Fly
- *Subjects*: Dev → DevOps hand‑off — stop wasting time  
- Scenario: from zero to GraphQL in minutes  
- *Tricks / Tools*:  
  - Stop fighting your own system! Cursor can do it  
  - Cursor‑generated `docker-compose.yml`  
  - Health‑check script authored by Cursor to wait for services

## Step 5 — One‑Off Tasks Magic
- *Subjects*: Legacy → modern stack, validation safety nets  
- Scenario: data migration  
- *Tricks / Tools*:  
  - Cursor opens DB files, explores them

## Step 6 — Version‑Control Dance (Cursor × SmartGit)
- *Subjects*: Review discipline, partial staging, commit hygiene  
- *Tricks / Tools*:  
  - AI‑drafted commit messages  
  - SmartGit: 10 × your Git operations  
  - More `.cursorrules`: run the team’s checks  
- Extra 10 × trick:  
  - Use the right tools & libraries to catch errors early and to super‑power your IDE:  
    - **Strong‑type** your Python code! → use Pydantic and typing everywhere  
    - Unapologetically refuse dictionaries → make a Pydantic model  
    - Dev tools: Ruff, **Typer** (or mypy), uv, coverage … *(its own 1‑h talk)*  

## Step 7 — CLI Copilot Saves Your Day
- *Subjects*: Broader system troubleshooting with AI  
- Scenario: you bought a joystick to play Flight Simulator  
- *Tricks / Tools*:  
  - Let Cursor investigate, go on forums, find possible solutions  
  - Gain back hours of your weekend — have fun, be happier 🙂
