## üéì Key Learning Outcomes

1. **Smart Autocomplete**: Context-aware code completion that understands your project
2. **Automated Testing**: Generate comprehensive test suites that catch real bugs
3. **Codebase Intelligence**: Multi-file awareness and coordinated edits
4. **Systematic Debugging**: Detective-style investigation with comprehensive logging
5. **Database Design**: Production-ready schemas with proper relationships
6. **API Generation**: Instant GraphQL APIs without backend coding
7. **Team Integration**: Customize Cursor for consistent team workflows
8. **System Debugging**: Hardware troubleshooting with methodical Linux diagnostics

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cursor_class
   ```

2. **Follow the demo steps** in order (Step 0 ‚Üí Step 7)

3. **Activate Python environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate py312  # or your preferred environment
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

5. **Start with Step 0** and work through each demo at your own pace

## üí° Pro Tips

- Each demo builds on previous concepts
- Try the prompts exactly as shown, then experiment with variations
- Pay attention to the `.cursorrules` file evolution throughout the demos
- The "Inspector Columbo" debugging approach works for all types of problems!

## ü™û Meta: README Created with CursorAI

*A self-reflective moment...* 

This very README you're reading was created using the exact same CursorAI techniques demonstrated in the talk! The screenshot below shows the prompt and response that generated this comprehensive documentation:

![The Last Prompt - README Creation](images/lastprompt.png)

**The beautiful irony**: We used AI to document how to use AI for development. The README itself serves as a live demonstration of CursorAI's capabilities - transforming a simple request into a comprehensive, well-structured document with proper formatting, clear sections, and professional presentation.

*Like the Matrix within the Matrix, this is CursorAI all the way down...* ü§ñ‚ú®
