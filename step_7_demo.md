# Step 7 Demo: Linux Hardware Debugging Like Inspector Columbo

## Setup
- Ubuntu 22.04 system with flight simulator joystick not working
- User frustrated with hardware detection issues
- Goal: Systematically debug hardware problems using Linux diagnostic tools
- Demonstrate methodical investigation approach

## Demo Flow

### 1. Initial Problem Assessment
**Action**: User reports the issue:

```
I have plugged a joystick for flight simulator but it doesn't appear to work. ARRRGG Ubuntu !!!
can you please help me figure out what is going on ?
```

or

```
My system shuts down every day at 03:14 am without any warning... Help me figure out what is going on.
```

**Expected**: Cursor immediately starts systematic hardware investigation:
- Runs parallel diagnostic commands (`lsusb`, `ls /dev/input/`, `dmesg`)
- Checks for device detection at multiple levels
- Follows methodical troubleshooting approach

**Expected**: Cursor identifies the root cause:
- `/dev/input/js0` exists but is laptop accelerometer, not joystick
- Real joystick not detected by system at all
- Provides clear explanation with evidence

## Key Points to Highlight
- **Systematic Approach**: Like Inspector Columbo, methodically gather evidence
- **Parallel Diagnostics**: Run multiple commands simultaneously for efficiency
- **False Positive Detection**: Don't assume first result is correct
- **Clear Communication**: Explain technical findings in understandable terms
- **Actionable Solutions**: Provide concrete next steps


## Linux Hardware Mastery
This demonstrates Cursor can:
- Systematically debug complex hardware issues
- Use multiple Linux diagnostic tools in parallel
- Distinguish between similar device types
- Provide clear explanations of technical findings
- Guide users through methodical troubleshooting
- Apply "Inspector Columbo" investigation methodology

**The result**: A complete hardware diagnosis with clear explanation and actionable next steps, turning user frustration into understanding! üéÆüîç 



just cool:
```
Can you show me the raw data of my computer acclerometer again. it is amaizing.
