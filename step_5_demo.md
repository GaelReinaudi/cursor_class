# Step 5 Demo: From Database to GraphQL API in Minutes

## Setup
- Rich Postgres database with 7 interconnected tables from Step 4
- Complex relationships (users, tasks, categories, comments, etc.)
- Existing docker-compose.yml with Postgres service
- Goal: Add Hasura GraphQL and create instant API layer

## Demo Flow

### 1. Add Hasura GraphQL Engine
**Action**: Open chat and paste:

```
Add Hasura GraphQL engine to my docker-compose.yml. It should connect to the existing Postgres database and be accessible on port 8080. Make sure it can auto-introspect all the tables we created. Then start up both Postgres and Hasura services, wait for them to be ready, and verify that Hasura can see our database schema.
```

**Expected**: Cursor:
- Runs `docker-compose up -d postgres hasura`
- Waits for services to be healthy
- Checks that Hasura console is accessible
- Confirms database introspection worked

### 2. Track Tables and Relationships
**Action**: Request automatic schema discovery:

```
Connect to the Hasura console and track all our tables. Set up the foreign key relationships so GraphQL can follow the connections between users, tasks, categories, and comments.
```
```
Create some impressive GraphQL queries that showcase the power of our database relationships. Show me queries for:
- Users with their assigned tasks and comments
- Tasks grouped by category with assignee details  
- Comment threads with user information
- Category statistics with task counts
```

**Expected**: Cursor:
- Opens Hasura console at http://localhost:8080
- Tracks all 7 tables automatically
- Configures relationships based on foreign keys
- Shows the generated GraphQL schema


### 3. Auto-Generated API Documentation
**Action**: Request documentation generation:

```
Generate comprehensive API documentation showing all our GraphQL queries, mutations, and the schema structure. Include examples for each table and relationship.
```

**Expected**: Cursor creates:
- `GRAPHQL_API.md` with complete documentation
- Query examples for every table
- Relationship navigation examples
- Mutation examples for CRUD operations
- Schema visualization

## Key Points to Highlight
- **Instant API**: Complex database â†’ GraphQL API in minutes
- **Auto-discovery**: Hasura introspects existing schema automatically
- **Relationship mapping**: Foreign keys become GraphQL relationships
- **Real-time ready**: Subscriptions available out of the box
- **No backend coding**: Full API without writing application code

## Advanced GraphQL Features
**Action**: Show Cursor's GraphQL expertise:

```
What advanced Hasura features should we set up? Permissions, subscriptions, event triggers? Show me how to make this production-ready.
```

**Expected**: Cursor suggests:
- Role-based permissions for different user types
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Event triggers for business logic
- Performance optimization tips
- Security best practices

## The Complete Stack Demo
**Terminal Output Shows**:
```
ðŸš€ Services Status:
âœ… PostgreSQL: Running (port 5432)
âœ… Hasura GraphQL: Running (port 8080)

ðŸ“Š Schema Discovery:
âœ… 7 tables tracked automatically
âœ… 12 relationships configured
âœ… GraphQL schema generated

ðŸŽ¯ API Capabilities:
âœ… Complex queries with deep relationships
âœ… Real-time subscriptions ready
âœ… Full CRUD operations via mutations
âœ… Auto-generated documentation
```

## Zero to Production API
This demonstrates Cursor can:
- Transform existing databases into modern APIs
- Handle complex relationship mapping automatically
- Generate comprehensive documentation
- Create monitoring and health checks
- Bridge database design to API layer seamlessly

**The result**: A production-ready GraphQL API built on top of your existing database schema, without writing a single line of backend code!
